*Assignment 1 - The Coalition Race

The objective of this program is to design an object-oriented system and gain implementation experience in C++ while using classes, standard data structures, and unique C++ properties such as the “Rule of 5”. learned how to handle memory in C++ and avoid memory leaks.
The program simulates the "Coalition Race" in SPLand based on a graph that contains political parties as vertices and collaborations as edges.

*Assignment 2 - Set Card Game

The goal of the program is to practice concurrent programming on Java 8 environment, and give basic experience with unit testing using Java Threads and Java Synchronization. The game contains a deck of 81 cards. Each card contains a drawing with four features (color, number, shape, shading).A Set is three cards where every feature is either all the same, or all different. Grab as many Sets as you can find: the player with the most cards at the end wins!
The game's active components contain the dealer and the players. The players play together simultaneously on the table, trying to find a legal set of 3 cards. They do so by placing tokens on the cards, and once they place the third token, they should ask the dealer to check if the set is legal.
